# Job-Tracker-BeCode

## Repository for my job tracker project.


Realized using Express for the backend, mongoDb as the database of choice thanks to Atlas and simple ejs and css.
Simple CRUD, user login/register, it keeps in memory job applications that the user saves for later.
Not the most practical to use, but a good exercise.
