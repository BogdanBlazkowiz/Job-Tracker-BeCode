# Job-Tracker-BeCode

## Repository for my job tracker project.


Realized using Express for the backend, mongoDb as the database of choice thanks to Atlas and simple ejs and css.
Simple CRUD, user login/register, it keeps in memory job applications that the user saves for later.
Not the most practical to use, but a good exercise.

Link above leads to a demo of it, deployed using render. The css for screens larger than 1280px by 1024px isn't perfectly responsive, I ran out of time at the end of the project due to focussing on other features.
